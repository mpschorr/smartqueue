# Smart Queue

A song player that shuffles songs while keeping songs that should be next to each other next to each other.

### System Examples
- "Isometric" by Madeon fades into "You're On", so they should be kept together during the shuffle
- "Tear" by Anamanaguchi fades into "We Die", so they should be kept together
- "Nirvana" by Madeon fades into "Mania", so they should be kept together

### Plans
- Actual playing functionality
- Priority system, 1 for "they sound good together", 2 for "they sound amazing together", 3 for "they fade into eachother", etc.
- Different audio files for what song is next or previous in the queue
